Introduction
============

`PyAero <index.html>`_ is an open-source airfoil contour analysis and CFD meshing tool. The main intention of writing the software was to make an easy to use tool for 2D airfoil meshing. Meshes generated by `PyAero <index.html>`_ are intended to be used in subsequent CFD analysis.

`PyAero <index.html>`_, at least at the moment, does not do the CFD calculation itself. At a later stage it might be possible that `PyAero <index.html>`_ will be interfaced (i.e. export meshes in the respective format(s)) with existing open source CFD methods like `SU2 <http://su2.stanford.edu>`_ or similar.

Airfoil contours (at least legacy airfoils) often are described through a limited number of points (approx. 60 points). When meshing such contours, if not interpolated by splines, the resulting mesh and numerical solutions based on it would end up with artefacts. These would deteriorate the quality of the analysis results.

Therefore, in addition to the mesh generation module, some additional features have been implemented. These features are intended to be able to analyze and improve the airfoil contour. The improvement process is supported by point insertion and spline interpolation techniques. First and second derivatives of the contour allow for control of the contour as well as curvature smoothness.

To reflect *real* shapes, an option for creating a trailing edge and blending it to the contour is implemented.

The following figures show an example mesh for the airfoil **RAE2822** and a magnification of leading edge and trailing edge sections.
