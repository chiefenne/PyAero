   Example calculation result

Above analysis result was obtained using the CFD code AVL-FIRE. It is an unsteady laminar 3D calculation of 
the RG14 airfoil. The mesh was thickened with several layers in spanwise direction in order to allow for 
turbulent fluctuations in all three dimensions. The calculation result shown is based on pure laminar 
settings (i.e. no turbulence model switched on). Later (result not shown) a LES calculation using the 
Kobayashi SGS model was done. With the applied mesh resolution both approaches lead to quite similar results.

**Features**

 - Load and display airfoil contour files
 - Airfoil splining and refining
 
   - Prepare contour for meshing
   - Splining is done to get a smooth contour and sufficient contour points
   - Refining allows to improve leading and trailing edge resolution
 
 - Airfoil contour analysis
 
   - Analyze gradient, curvature, and curvature circle at the leading edge, i.e. leadinge edge radius
 
 - Trailing edge generation
 
   - Specification of the trailing edge thickness (blunt trailing edge)
   - Smart blending functions (arbitrary polynomial)
   - Independent blending for upper and lower contour (e.g. for strong cambered airfoils)
 
 - Automatic generation of block-strcuctured meshes for airfoils
 
   - Currently only single element C-type meshes are supported
 
 - Mesh control
 
   - Boundary layer region
   - Wake region
   - Windtunnel
